## What is VeriTXT ?
It is a tool to detect whether some text is AI-generated or human-written.
## Project Description
  This repository demonstrates the development and evaluation of machine learning models designed to
distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text. The project encompasses the full
spectrum of the data science lifecycle, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis
(EDA), model training, and performance evaluation. Three primary models—Logistic Regression,
Neural Networks, and Naive Bayes—were selected for comparison based on their
effectiveness in this binary classification task. A user-friendly web application is also implemented to
allow users to test the VeriTXT tool with their own piece of text as well as interact with the models and visualize their results. 
This initiative aims to provide robust tools for combating misinformation and ensuring content authenticity in this
digital age.
