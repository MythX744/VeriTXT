distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text. The project encompasses the full
spectrum of the data science lifecycle, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis
(EDA), model training, and performance evaluation. Three primary models—Logistic Regression,
Neural Networks, and Naive Bayes—were selected for comparison based on their
effectiveness in this binary classification task. The Logistic Regression model emerged as the
most accurate and reliable, demonstrating superior performance across multiple metrics. The
report also highlights the implementation of a user-friendly web application interface that
allows users to interact with the models and visualize their results. This initiative aims to
provide robust tools for combating misinformation and ensuring content authenticity in this
digital age.
