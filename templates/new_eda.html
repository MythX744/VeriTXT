      <h3>AI generated vs Human content distribution</h3>
      <p>The bar chart displayed on the right illustrates the distribution of texts within our dataset, categorized based on their origin—either human-written or AI-generated. The x-axis represents these two categories, where '0' signifies human-written text and '1' indicates AI-generated text. The y-axis denotes the count of texts in each category. From the graph, it is evident that human-written texts (category '0') significantly outnumber the AI-generated texts (category '1'). This disparity highlights the prevalence of human-written content in our dataset, providing a substantial basis for comparative analysis in our exploratory data analysis (EDA).</p>

      <h3>TOP 25 Occuring words for Generated Text Unigram </h3>
      <p>This bar chart illustrates the top 25 most frequently occurring words in a generated text unigram, with "student" being the most frequent, appearing nearly 50,000 times. Following closely are "car" and "make," each with frequencies above 30,000. Other common words include "help," "like," "also," "people," "school," and "time," each appearing between 20,000 to 30,000 times. Towards the lower end of the top 25, words such as "vote," "take," "usage," "use," "would," "limit," "way," and "lead" have frequencies closer to 10,000. The prevalence of these words suggests that topics related to students, activities, and various concepts are central to the generated text, providing insight into the main themes and focus areas within the content.</p>
